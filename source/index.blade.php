			<h3>Helping local residents</h3>
			<p>
				Keith - local Boston resident - middle age - reached out and mentioned that he lacks some basic computer skills. He mentioned how hard it is to find gainful employment with almost no computer skills, and asked if we can help. Even though it’s different from what we’ve done before, we thought - this is what we’re here for.

			<p>This is what Boston Volunteer is about.</p>
